This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Here I'm using React Hooks to create the todo app. The todo list not getting stored anywhere so after the page reload
the added data will be gone.


To run the app locally:

*  clone the app and go to the app folder
*  `npm install` to install the app dependencies
*  run the `npm start` to run locally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
